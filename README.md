## Searchlight

### Introduction

Searchlight is a web app to help indie music labels keep track of the songs that they're following. It shows them data that may be relevant to a label when deciding whether a song is interesting or not. 

Searchlight is a layer on top of the Chartmetric API and Spotify API. The only data we store about songs is song namess, artists, and Spotify ID. 

### We use...
